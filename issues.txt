- AutoLogout class that I defined takes no params error
solved it by taking get_response param in its constructor

- django.core.management.base.SystemCheckError: SystemCheckError: System check identified some issues:

ERRORS:
?: (admin.E410) 'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware' must be in MIDDLEWARE in order to use the admin application.
        HINT: Insert 'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware' before 'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware'
